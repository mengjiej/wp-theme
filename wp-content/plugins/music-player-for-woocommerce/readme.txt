**Setting up the Music Players through the products' pages**

The Music Players are configured from the products pages and Dokan interface.

**Settings Interface**

*   Include music player: checkbox to include the music player in the product's page, or not.
*   Include in: radio button to decide where to display the music player, in pages with a single entry, multiple entries, or both (both cases by default).
*   Merge in grouped products: in grouped products, display the "Add to cart" buttons and quantity fields in the players rows.

**How the Pro version of the Music Player for WooCommerce protect the audio files?**

If the "Protect the file" checkbox was ticked in the product's page, and was entered an integer number through the attribute: "Percent of audio used for protected playbacks", the plugin will create a truncated copy of the audio files for selling (or the audio files for demo) into the "/wp-content/plugins/wcmp" directory, to be used as demo. The sizes of the audio files for demo are a percentage of the sizes of the original files (the integer number entered in the player's settings). So, the users cannot access to the original audio files, from the public pages of the products.

**Music Player for WooCommerce - Playlist Widget**

The widget allows to include a playlist on sidebars, with the downloadable files associated to all products with the music player enabled, or for only some of the products.

The widget settings:

*	Title: the title of the widget on sidebar.
*	Products IDs: enter the ids of products to include in the playlist, separated by comma, or the * symbol to include all products.
*	Playlist layout: select between the new playlist layout and the original one.
*	Player layout: select the layout of music players (the widget uses only the play/pause control)
*   Preload: to decide if preload the audio files, their metadata, or don't preload nothing at all. This attribute has a global scope, and will modify the default settings.
*	Play all: play all players in the page (one after the other). This attribute has a global scope, and will modify the default settings.
*	Highlight the current product: if the checkbox is ticked, and the user is in the page of a product, and it is included in the playlist, the corresponding item would be highlighted in the playlist.
*	Continue playing after navigate: if the checkbox is ticked, and there is a song playing when navigates, the player will continue playing after loading the webpage, in the same position.

Note: In mobiles devices where the direct action of user is required for playing audios and videos, the plugin cannot start playing dynamically.

	`[wcmp-playlist products_ids="*" highlight_current_product="1"]`

*	cover: allows to include the featured images in the playlist. The possible values are: 0 or 1, 0 is the value by default

	`[wcmp-playlist products_ids="*" cover="1"]`

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Q: Why the audio file is played partially? =

A: If you decide to protect the audio files, the plugin creates a truncated version of the file to be used as demo and prevent that the original file be copied by unauthorized users.

= Q: Why the music player is not loading on page? =

A: Verify that the theme used in your website, includes the function wp_footer(); in the template file "footer.php" or the template file "index.php"

= Q: What can I do if the woocommerce_music_player directory exists and the premium version of plugin cannot be installed? =

A: Go to the plugins section in WordPress, deactivate the free version of Music Player for WooCommerce, and delete it ( Don't worry, this process don't modify players configured with the free version of the plugin), and finally install and activate the premium version of plugin.

= Q: Can be modified the size of audio files played in secure mode? =

A: In the pro version of the plugin the files for demo are generated dynamically to prevent the access to the original files.

Each time save the data of a product, the files for demo are deleted and generated again, so, you simply should modify the percentage of the audio file to be used for demo in the product's page.
